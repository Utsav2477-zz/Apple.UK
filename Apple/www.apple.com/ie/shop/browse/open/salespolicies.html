					<h3 class="as-help-helpoverlaysubtitle">Returns</h3> 
					<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">You have the right to cancel your order, return a product or cancel a service contract for any reason. To return a product purchased from the Apple Store or cancel a service contract, please send your intent to return or cancel to us anytime prior to the date 14 days after the date you, or a person indicated by you, acquired physical possession of the product(s), or from the date of conclusion of the service contract. If you ordered multiple products in the same order, please send your intent to return to us anytime prior to the date 14 days after the date you, or a person indicated by you, acquired physical possession of the last product in the order. To exercise these rights, you need only provide us with a clear expression of your intent to return a product or cancel an order or service contract.  You can notify us by either sending the model form found at the end of this Policy, submitting the electronic form found online at <a href="https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/browse/account/home" data-s-object-id="d57dc07b18b48e7e48349f9a1857f04e"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 1 | AOS: account/home" data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">http://www.apple.com/ie/shop/account/home</a>, calling our freephone number on 1800 92 38 98 or sending an email to <a href="mailto:contactus.ie@euro.apple.com">contactus.ie@euro.apple.com</a>.</p>

					<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">Once you notify us of your intent to return, simply return the product with the original receipt and original packaging to us within 14 days. Once we pick up the product or, in the event you are delivering the product to the carrier, we receive the product or proof that it has been shipped, we’ll provide you with a refund based on the original payment method within 14 days.</p> 
	        <p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">Please note that you may not return the following, except in case of defect or lack of conformity:</p>
	        <ul class="as-help-helpoverlaylist">

	        <li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">Services, like gift packaging, after the services have been fully performed if performance has begun with your prior express consent and acknowledgement that you lose your right of withdrawal once the services have been fully performed. If services have not been fully performed, and you have requested performance to begin within 14 days from the date of conclusion of the service contract, you will be charged an amount proportional to the services rendered until the time you have informed us of your intent to cancel the service contract.</li>

					<h3 class="as-help-helpoverlaysubtitle">Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections</h3> 
<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">Apple reserves the right to change prices for products displayed on the Apple Store at any time and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. Any price changes will not affect an order that has already been accepted by Apple. In the event of a pricing error, we will notify you of the error and allow you to either proceed with the transaction at the correct price or cancel your order at no cost to you. Additional information about pricing and taxes is available in the Payment & Pricing section of the Help page located at <a href="https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/help/payments" data-s-object-id="25f616a4471a9d4cdc4f089cde435f04"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 3 | AOS: help/payments" data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">http://www.apple.com/ie/shop/help/payments</a>.
</p> 

<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">In addition to your right to cancel your order, return a product or cancel a service contract for any reason as explained above, should Apple reduce its price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel free to contact the Apple Store by freephone on 1800 92 38 98 to request a refund or credit of the difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit, you must contact Apple within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events.</p>

					<h3 class="as-help-helpoverlaysubtitle">Order, Order Acknowledgement and Order Acceptance</h3> 
<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">To place an order for products or services at the Apple Store, you can visit the store website at <a href="#" astro:id="link" astro:url="node:home">http://www.apple.com/uk/shop</a> or use the Apple Store mobile app, and then simply add the products you wish to your shopping bag, check out (using your chosen payment method) with your Apple ID or as a guest customer, and have your items shipped to you or to a person designated by you. Alternatively, you can call the Apple Store freephone number on 1800 92 38 98 Mon-Fri 0900-2000 and an Apple Specialist will assist you through the entire order process, from product selection to payment method. Whichever way you choose to order, you will be given an opportunity to review your order prior to submitting it. Once you have placed your order, we will provide you with a web order number.</p>
			<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">Within a few minutes after we receive your order, we’ll email you an order confirmation. As with the web order number, the order confirmation email does not signify our acceptance of your order; we are simply confirming that we received your order. Once we have processed your order and prepared it for shipping, we will send you an email stating that we have accepted your order, which will include the shipment details (the “Shipment Notification Email”).  The decision to accept your order is in our sole discretion. Because we want to make sure that we have your product available, we won’t accept your order until we have prepared your product for shipping. In most cases, this will be within twenty-four hours for items that are in stock.  For items that are not in stock, you will receive the Order Acceptance Email when the item becomes available and has been prepared for shipping, which in no event will be later than the “ships” timeframe presented to you at checkout.  Once we have sent and you have received the Order Acceptance Email, Apple will have formed a contract with you (we will include the key terms of the contract in this acceptance email).  All that remains at that point is for us to deliver the product(s) to you, which we will do straightaway so you can begin enjoying the amazing item(s) you purchased at the Apple Store.</p>

Please visit <a href="https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/help/shipping_delivery" data-s-object-id="8b746e0a858011044f7197303d688f1a"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 4 | AOS: help/shipping_delivery" data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">http://www.apple.com/ie/shop/help/shipping_delivery</a> for the current shipping rates and fees.

We will, however, notify you of any significant delays, and work with you to ensure a smooth delivery.</p>
  						<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">As Apple takes care of the dispatch of the products you purchase on the Apple Store, the risk of loss of, or damage to, product(s) shall pass to you when you, or a person designated by you, acquires physical possession of the product(s). Title in the product(s) shall pass to you when the product(s) is picked up by the carrier from our warehouse. At this point, you will receive the Shipment Notification Email. If there are any issues with delivery, please contact Apple to resolve. </p>
