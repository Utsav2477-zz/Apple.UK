In that unlikely event, we invite you to review the following terms related to returning a product.</p>

					<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">To return an undamaged product purchased at the Apple Store, please contact us at 8000 444 0396 between 10:00 and 19:00 Sunday to Thursday within 14 days from the date you receive the product. Once we receive your returned product, we’ll exchange it or offer a refund based upon the original payment method.  Please note the following:</p>
	        <ul class="as-help-helpoverlaylist">
	        <li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">Products can be returned only in the country in which they were originally purchased.</li>

	        <li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">Opened software cannot be returned if it contained a seal with the software license on the outside of the package and you could read the software license before opening its packaging. As an exception, you may return Apple-branded software if you do not agree to the licensing terms; however, you may not retain or otherwise use any copies of returned software.</li>

<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">With regards to pricing, Apple reserves the right to change prices for products displayed at/on the Apple Store at any time, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. Additional information about pricing and sales tax is available on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ae-edu/shop/help/payments" data-s-object-id="c0a221258783be959045e3331304568c"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 1 | AOS: help/payments" data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">Payment & Pricing</a> page.

To receive the refund or credit you must contact Apple within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events.  Price protection is only available for up to 10 units of a particular product.

Your receipt of an order confirmation, however, does not signify Apple's acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. The Apple Store reserves the right at any time after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any reason.

Since the actual delivery of your order can be impacted by many events beyond Apple’s control once it leaves our facilities, Apple cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth delivery.</p>		
              <p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">As Apple takes care of the dispatch of the products you purchase on the Apple Store, the risk of loss of, or damage to, product(s) shall pass to you when you, or a person designated by you, acquires physical possession of the product(s). Title in the product(s) shall pass to you when the product(s) is picked up by the carrier from our warehouse. At this point, you will receive the Shipment Notification Email.
