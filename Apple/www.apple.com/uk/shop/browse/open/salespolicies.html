	Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections
</h3>
<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">
	Apple reserves the right to change prices for products displayed on the Apple Store at any time and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. Any price changes will not affect an order that has already been accepted by Apple. In the event of a pricing error, we will notify you of the error and allow you to either proceed with the transaction at the correct price or cancel your order at no cost to you. Additional information about pricing and taxes is available in the Payment &amp; Pricing section of the Help page located at <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/help/payments" data-s-object-id="9ff6a9061f9ffe3eb583655e40dd79d9"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 0 | AOS: help/payments" data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/help/payments</a>.
</p>
<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">
	In addition to your right to cancel your order, return a product or cancel a service contract for any reason as explained above, should Apple reduce its price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel free to contact the Apple Store by freephone on 0800 048 0408 to request a refund or credit of the difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit, you must contact Apple within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events.

	Order, Order Acknowledgement, and Order Acceptance

<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">
	To place an order for products or services at the Apple Store, you can visit the store website at <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/" data-s-object-id="d819ad1f847c79a37b686744c0bed77b"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 0 | AOS: " data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">http://www.apple.com/uk</a> or use the Apple Store mobile app, and then simply add the products you wish to your shopping bag, check out (using your chosen payment method) with your Apple ID or as a guest customer, and have your items shipped to you or to a person designated by you. Alternatively, you can call the Apple Store freephone number on 0800 048 0408 Mon-Fri 08:00-20:00, Sat-Sun 09:00-18:00 and an Apple Specialist will assist you through the entire order process, from product selection to payment method. Whichever way you choose to order, you will be given an opportunity to review your order prior to submitting it. Once you have placed your order, we will provide you with a web order number.
</p>
<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">
	Within a few minutes after we receive your order, we’ll email you an order confirmation. As with the web order number, the order confirmation email does not signify our acceptance of your order; we are simply confirming that we received your order. Once we have processed your order and prepared it for shipping, we will send you an email stating that we have accepted your order, which will include the shipment details (the “Shipment Notification Email”). The decision to accept your order is in our sole discretion. Because we want to make sure that we have your product available, we won’t accept your order until we have prepared your product for shipping. In most cases, this will be within 24 hours for items that are in stock. For items that are not in stock, you will receive the Order Acceptance Email when the item becomes available and has been prepared for shipping, which in no event will be later than the “ships” timeframe presented to you at checkout. Once we have sent and you have received the Order Acceptance Email, Apple will have formed a contract with you (we will include the key terms of the contract in this acceptance email). All that remains at that point is for us to deliver the product(s) to you, which we will do straightaway so you can begin enjoying the amazing item(s) you purchased at the Apple Store.

	Apple offers pickup points from convenient locations for many of the items available on the Online Store. Certain products, however, may not qualify for collection at pickup points. Only you or the person designated by you may pick up the item(s) purchased. A form of identity and order number will be required for collection by you. Or, you may designate a third party to pick up your order. You must provide the name and email address of the third party and the third party will need to bring a form of identity and order number for collection. Apple is not responsible for actions taken by the third party once your item(s) have been picked up. Apple will notify you when your order is ready and the date by which you need to pick up your items. Apple will also send you a reminder or two, just in case it slips your mind. If you don’t pick up your order, Apple may cancel it. Items purchased on the Online Store for Business or the Online Store for Education and items purchased with loan financing may not be collected from pickup points.

	Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections
</h3>
<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">
	Apple reserves the right to change prices for products displayed on the Apple Online Store at any time and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. Any price changes will not affect an order that has already been accepted by Apple. In the event of a pricing error, we will notify you of the error and allow you to either proceed with the transaction at the correct price or cancel your order at no cost to you. Additional information about pricing and taxes is available in the Payment & Pricing section of the Help page located at <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/help/payments" data-s-object-id="9ff6a9061f9ffe3eb583655e40dd79d9"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 0 | AOS: help/payments" data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/help/payments</a>.

<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">
	In addition to your right to cancel your order, return a product or cancel a service contract for any reason as explained above, should Apple reduce its price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel free to contact the Apple Online Store by freephone on 0800 048 0408 to request a refund or credit of the difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit, you must contact Apple within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events.

	Order, Order Acknowledgement, and Order Acceptance
</h3>
<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">
	To place an order for products or services at the Apple Online Store, you can visit the store website at <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/" data-s-object-id="d819ad1f847c79a37b686744c0bed77b"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 0 | AOS: " data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">http://www.apple.com/uk</a> or the Apple Store mobile app, and then simply add the products you wish to your shopping cart, check out (using your chosen payment method) with your Apple ID or as a guest customer, and choose for each of your items to either pick up from an Apple Retail Store on the same day, have your item(s) shipped to you, or have your item(s) shipped to an Apple Retail Store to be collected by you or a person designated by you, or a combination of these methods if you’re ordering several items. Alternatively, you can call the Apple Online Store freephone number on 0800 048 0408 Mon-Fri 08:00-20:00, Sat-Sun 09:00-18:00 and an Apple Specialist will assist you through the entire order process, from product selection to payment method. Either way you choose to order, you will be given an opportunity to review your order prior to submitting it. Once you have placed your order, we will provide you with a web order number.
</p>
<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">
	Within a few minutes after we receive your order, we’ll email you an order confirmation. As with the web order number, the order confirmation email does not signify our acceptance of your order; we are simply confirming that we received your order. For orders where we are shipping any of your items to you or to an Apple Retail Store, once we have processed your order and prepared it for shipping, we will send you an email stating that we have accepted your order, which will include the shipment details (the “Shipment Notification Email”). For orders where you are to pick up an item from an Apple Retail Store, we will send you an email or an SMS stating that we have accepted your order, which will include when your items will be available to pick up from your selected Apple Retail Store (the “Pick-Up Notification”). The decision to accept your order is in our sole discretion. Because we want to make sure that we have your product available, we won’t accept your order until we have prepared your product for shipping or confirmed that it is in stock at your selected Apple Retail Store. In most cases, this will be within 24 hours for items that are in stock and need to be shipped, or less for items already in stock and available to pick up at your selected Apple Retail Store. For items that are not in stock, you will receive the Order Acceptance Email when the item becomes available and has been prepared for shipping, which in no event will be later than the “ships” timeframe presented to you at checkout. Once we have sent and you have received the Order Acceptance Email, Apple will have formed a contract with you (we will include the key terms of the contract in this acceptance email).
