(To make it easier to read, we will refer to these entities as the “Apple Store” in this policy.)

<div class="topic">
<b class="as-helpdetails-strongtext"><a></a><a name="returns"></a><u>Standard Return Policy</u></b> <br/><br/>We fundamentally believe you will be thrilled with the products you purchase from the Apple Store. That’s because we go out of our way to ensure that they’re designed and built to be just what you need. We understand, however, that sometimes a product may not be what you expected it to be. In that event, we invite you to review the following terms related to returning a product.<br/>Importantly, the rights described in this policy are <u>in addition</u> to the statutory rights to which you may be entitled under the Australian Consumer Law and other applicable Australian consumer protection laws and regulations.<br/>Please note there may be limitations on your right to return and obtain a refund for products, however these limits will always be subject to your statutory rights.<br/>For any undamaged product, simply return it with its included accessories and packaging along with the original receipt (or gift receipt) and original packaging within 14 days of the date you receive the product and we’ll exchange it or offer a refund based upon the original payment method. However, please note that we will only remit refunds to a Australian bank account where the name of the bank account holder matches the payor’s name/information.  Please also note that we only remit refunds domestically and cannot remit refunds outside of Australia. In addition, please note the following:<br/><br/>



<ul class="as-help-helpoverlaylist">
<li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">Products can be returned only in the country or region in which they were originally purchased.</li>
<li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">Except where required under the Australian Consumer Law or other applicable consumer protection laws or regulations, the following products are not eligible for return: electronic software downloads, subscriptions to the Software-Up-To-Date program, Apple Gift Cards, and any Apple Developer products.</li>
<li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">In the case of items returned with a gift receipt, Apple will offer you an Apple Gift Card equal to the purchase price of the gift, including tax and any other fees.</li>
<li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">Except where required under the Australian Consumer Law or other applicable consumer protection laws or regulations, opened software cannot be returned if it contained a seal with the software license on the outside of the package and you could read the software license before opening its packaging. As an exception, you may return Apple- branded software if you do not agree to the licensing terms; however, you may not retain or otherwise use any copies of returned software.</li>
<li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">For returns to an Apple Retail Store for cash, cash equivalent, and cheque transactions over AUD $870, Apple will refund by bank transfer.</li>
<li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">Should you wish to return ten or more of the same product, you must return to the Apple Store where originally purchased.</li>
<li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">Apple provides security features to enable you to protect your product in case of loss or theft.  If these features have been activated and cannot be disabled by the person in possession of the phone, Apple may refuse the return or exchange.</li>

Should Apple reduce its price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel free to visit an Apple Retail Store or contact the Apple Contact Center at 133-622 to request a refund or credit of the difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit you must contact Apple within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events.
<br/><br/>


Price protection is only available for up to 10 units of a particular product. Additionally, we may require that you have the product with you or otherwise have proof of possession when requesting price protection. <br/><br/>

Prices shown are in Australian dollars. If you are paying for your order with an international Visa, MasterCard, or American Express credit card, please note that the purchase price may fluctuate with exchange rates. In addition, your bank or credit card issuer may also charge you foreign conversion charges and fees, which may also increase the overall cost of your purchase. Please contact your bank or credit card issuer regarding these fees.

<b class="as-helpdetails-strongtext"><a name="orderacceptance"></a><u>Order Acceptance/Confirmation</u></b> <br/><br/>Apple may, in its sole discretion, refuse or cancel any order and limit order quantity.  Apple may also require additional qualifying information prior to accepting or processing any order.  Once we receive your Online or Call Centre order, we’ll provide you with an email order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation, however, does not signify Apple’s acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. The Apple Store reserves the right at any time after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. If Apple cancels an order after you have already been billed, Apple will refund the billed amount.

<b class="as-helpdetails-strongtext"><a name="#"></a><u>In-Store Pickup and Return</u></b> <br/><br/>
Apple offers in-store pickup for many of the items available on the Online Store. Certain products and payment methods, however, may not qualify for in-store pickup. Only you or the person designated by you may pick up the item(s) purchased. A government-issued photo ID and order number will be required for pickup. Apple will notify you when your order is ready and the date by which you need to pick up your items. We’ll also send you reminder or two, just in case it slips your mind. If you don’t pick up your order, Apple may cancel it.

If you select in-store pickup, you may designate a third party to pick up your order. You must provide the name and email address of the third party. Please note that certain products and payment methods are not eligible for in-store pickup by a third party. The third party will need to bring a government issued photo ID and order number for pickup. Apple is not responsible for actions taken by the third party once your item(s) have been picked up.

Given the popularity and/or supply constraints of some of our products, Apple may have to limit the number of products available for purchase. Trust us, we’re building them as fast as we can. Apple reserves the right to change quantities available for purchase at any time, even after you place an order. Furthermore, there may be occasions when Apple confirms your order but subsequently learns that it cannot supply the ordered product. In the event we cannot supply a product you ordered, Apple will cancel the order and refund your purchase price in full.
