	<h3 class="as-help-helpoverlaysubtitle">Hong Kong Apple Store for Consumers</h3>
	<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">Thanks for shopping at Apple. We appreciate the fact that you like to buy the cool stuff we build. We also want to make sure you have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring, evaluating, and purchasing our products, whether you’re at Apple Online or on the phone with the Apple Contact Center. (To make it visually easier on both of us, we’ll refer to these entities as the “Apple Store” in this policy.)</p>
	<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">As with any shopping experience, there are terms and conditions that apply to transactions at an Apple Store. Please note that by placing an order with the Apple Store, you agree to the terms set forth below along with Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/hk/en/privacy" target="_blank" data-s-object-id="2d5921e6bc4ae14fe6abbf68964c6921"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 0 | AOS: privacy" data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="http://apple.com/legal/internet-services/terms/site.html" target="_blank" data-s-object-id="0189a76ab57979fd4fbc7cf6698f5bf7"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 1 | AOS: apple.com/legal/internet-services/terms/site.html" data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">Website Terms of Use</a>.</p>

	<h3 class="as-help-helpoverlaysubtitle">Standard Exchange Policy</h3>
	<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">All products purchased at Apple Store in Hong Kong cannot be returned or exchanged under these Terms. Exceptions for exchange will be allowed for defective products only. If you believe that your product is defective, please call Apple Store Customer Service at (852) 800-908-988. If Apple determines, in its sole discretion, that the product is defective, you will be eligible to exchange your product.  Apple reserves the right to test your defective products.</p>
    <p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">To send back a product eligible for exchange (not purchased in volume), simply follow the instruction of Apple Store Customer Service and send back your product with the original receipt (or gift receipt) and original packaging within 14 days of the date you receive the product.</p>
	<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">Please note the following:</p>
	<ul class="as-help-helpoverlaylist">
		<li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">Eligible products can be exchanged only in the country or region in which they were originally purchased.</li>
		<li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">Apple provides security features to enable you to protect your product in case of loss or theft. If you do not disable these features prior to sending back your device for an exchange, Apple may refuse to exchange.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="topic" id="topic-3">
	<h3 class="as-help-helpoverlaysubtitle">Exchange of Products Purchased in Volume</h3>
	<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">In addition to the Standard Exchange Policy, the following applies to exchanges of any product purchased in volume (aggregate of more than 4 per order or across multiple orders) from the same product category: </p>
	<ul class="as-help-helpoverlaylist">
		<li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">Must be sent back within 7 days of the date you receive the product; and</li>

	<h3 class="as-help-helpoverlaysubtitle">iPhone Purchase</h3>
	<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">The purchase and use of an iPhone is subject to terms and conditions found at: <a href="http://apple.com/legal/sla" target="_blank" data-s-object-id="90be20872b66a95ce894f64c194ea001"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 2 | AOS: apple.com/legal/sla" data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">http://www.apple.com/legal/sla/</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/hk/en/legal/warranty" target="_blank" data-s-object-id="45a1e2a834c96f2fe542b1653a63deb2"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 3 | AOS: legal/warranty" data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/</a>.

		<li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">A wireless service plan is required to activate all iPhone features.</li>
		<li class="as-help-helpoverlaylistitem">Making unauthorized modifications to the software on an iPhone violates the iPhone software license agreement. Should you be unable to use your iPhone due to an unauthorized software modification, its repair will not be covered under the warranty.</li>

</div>

<div class="topic" id="topic-5">
	<h3 class="as-help-helpoverlaysubtitle">Wireless Services</h3>
	<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">Some Apple products utilize wireless services that may incur extra costs and are governed by the terms of a separate agreement between you and your selected wireless service provider. Exchanging a product at the Apple Store does not automatically cancel your wireless service. You are responsible for your wireless service agreement and for any applicable fees associated with your wireless account.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic" id="topic-6">
	<h3 class="as-help-helpoverlaysubtitle">Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections</h3>
	<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">With regards to pricing, Apple reserves the right to change prices for products displayed at/on the Apple Store at any time, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. In the event of a pricing error, we will notify you of the error and allow you to either proceed with the transaction at the correct price or cancel your order at no cost to you. Additional information about pricing and sales tax is available on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/hk/shop/help/payments" target="_blank" data-s-object-id="65c779fa4184ab8741be3b8283296ec0"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 4 | AOS: help/payments" data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">Payment & Pricing</a> page.</p>
	<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">Should Apple reduce its price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel free to contact the Apple Contact Center at 800-908-988 to request a refund or credit of the difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit you must contact Apple within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic" id="topic-7">
	<h3 class="as-help-helpoverlaysubtitle">Order Receipt and Status Check</h3>
	<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">Information contained at the Apple Store constitutes an invitation to treat. No such information constitutes an offer by us to supply any products. By placing an order, you make an offer to us to purchase the products you have selected on these terms and conditions. We may or may not accept your offer at our discretion. Once we receive your order, we’ll provide you with an email order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation, however, does not signify Apple’s acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. The decision to accept your order is in our sole discretion. Because we want to make sure that we have your product available, we won’t accept your order until we have prepared your product for shipping. In most cases this will be within twenty-four hours for items that are in stock. Apple may, in its sole discretion, refuse or cancel any order and limit order quantity. Apple may require additional qualifying information prior to accepting or processing any order. After you receive our email order confirmation, you can visit Order Status online to check your orders status at anytime. When the order status message shows “Preparing for Shipment”, it means that we have accepted your order.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic" id="topic-8">
	<h3 class="as-help-helpoverlaysubtitle">Shipping & Delivery</h3>
	<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">Please review the <a href="https://www.apple.com/hk/shop/help/shipping_delivery" target="_blank" data-s-object-id="c113d1406deb0eca2638bd2589432831"  data-evar1="AOS: open/salespolicies | popup-content-1 | Astro Link | 5 | AOS: help/shipping_delivery" data-evar30="open/salespolicies/popup-content-1">Shipping & Pickup page</a> to learn about how and when you will receive the products you purchased from the Apple Store. Since the actual delivery of your order can be impacted by many events beyond Apple’s control once it leaves our facilities, Apple cannot be held liable for late deliveries. The estimated shipment date on your order is based on product availability, payment processing time, and warehouse processing time and does not include transit time. Payment processing will not begin until we receive all the information we need and full payment. Apple must receive your payment within 10 calendar days or your order will be cancelled.</p>
	<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">Apple Store products are delivered by appointed courier(s) during business hours Monday to Friday. Signature is required for all deliveries. In the event of an unsuccessful delivery, a calling card will be left to inform you to contact the courier to arrange a more convenient delivery day. We will send you an email after three delivery attempts requesting you to contact us within three days to arrange for re-delivery. If we do not hear from you within three days to arrange for re-delivery or if re-delivery is still unsuccessful, the relevant products of your order will be considered as cancelled and you will be subject to a 15% restocking fee. Delivery to a PO Box is not permitted for security reasons. We do not ship to freight forwarders. Customers with addresses on outlying islands may not receive door to door delivery. You will be subject to a 15% restocking fee if you request to cancel your order after the order is being prepared for shipment or shipped out. We cannot guarantee to suspend the shipment of your order, and it is your obligation to reject the delivery if it arrives at the shipment address as stated on your order. If the delivery is accepted, you will not be able to return it unless the product is defective.  We will make the refund for such cancelled orders based upon the original payment method. Please note that we will only remit refunds to a Hong Kong bank account where the name of the bank account holder matches the payor’s name/information. Please also note that we only remit refunds domestically and cannot remit refunds outside of Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">As Apple takes care of the dispatch of the products you purchase on the Apple Store, the risk of loss of, or damage to, product(s) shall pass to you when you, or a person designated by you, acquires physical possession of the product(s). Title in the product(s) shall pass to you when the product(s) is picked up by the carrier from our warehouse. At this point, you will receive the Shipment Notification Email.  If there are any issues with delivery, please contact Apple to resolve. </p>

<div class="topic" id="topic-8-1">
	<h3 class="as-help-helpoverlaysubtitle">In-Store Pickup</h3>
	<p class="as-help-helpoverlaysummary">Apple offers in-store pickup for many of the items available on the Online Store. Certain products and payment methods, however, may not qualify for in-store pickup. Only you may pick up the item(s) purchased. A government-issued photo ID and other required documents as stated on the emails sent to you will be required for pickup. Apple will notify you when your order is ready and the date by which you need to pick up your items, and we will apply a 15% restocking fee if the order is cancelled or not picked up by the date. We’ll also send you a reminder or two, just in case it slips your mind.
